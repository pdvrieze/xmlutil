/**
 * This example shows how a custom serializer together with a filter can be used to support non-xml xml documents
 * where tag names are dynamic/unique. This example is a solution to the question in #41.
 *
 * There are 2 versions, one is the CompatContainerSerializer. This version works on 0.80.0 and 0.80.1 but has
 * limitations in that it cannot inherit configuration or serializerModules. The improved version uses new properties
 * in the XML.XmlInput and XML.XmlOutput interfaces that allow new xml serializers to be created based on the
 * configuration of the encoder/decoder.
