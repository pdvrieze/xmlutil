# Introduction
* Gradle wrapper validation: ![Validate Gradle Wrapper](https://github.com/pdvrieze/xmlutil/workflows/Validate%20Gradle%20Wrapper/badge.svg)

This project is a cross-platform XML serialization (wrapping) library compatible with kotlin serialization. It provides
capabilities for Android, JVM and JS (alpha quality)

It also provides serialization support

**Help wanted**: Any help with extending this project is welcome. Help is especially needed for the following aspects:

* Documentation updates
* Testing, in particular more extensive tests. Some tests already exist for both JVM and Android
* Javascript support
  * Core Javascript support needs testing but should work. It is based on DOM so may be slow
  * Javascript serialization support: make serialization work on Javascript once possible
* Native support: Currently there is no implementation for Kotlin native. 

## Versioning scheme
This library is based upon the unstable [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) library. 
Until that library is stable, this library will use the kotlinx.serialization library version as a prefix and append a
release number.
While every effort is made to limit incompatible changes, this cannot be guaranteed even in "minor" versions when
the changes are due to bugs. These changes should be limited mainly to the serialization part of the library.

# How to use
The library is designed as a multiplatform kotlin module, but platform-specific versions can also be used were appropriate.
## Core
### multiplatform
```
   implementation("net.devrieze:xmlutil:0.20.0.1")
```
### JVM -- uses the stax API not available on Android
```
   implementation("net.devrieze:xmlutil-jvm:0.20.0.1")
```
### Android -- Uses the android streaming library
```
   implementation("net.devrieze:xmlutil-android:0.20.0.1")
```
### JS -- Wraps DOM
```
   implementation("net.devrieze:xmlutil-js:0.20.0.1")
```

```

# Serialization help
## Format
The entrypoint to the library is the `XML` format. There is a default, but often a child is better. A custom format
is created through:
```kotlin
val format = XML(mySerialModule) {  
    // configuration options
    autoPolymorphism = true 
}
```
The options available are:

| option                | description |
| --- | --- | 
| `repairNamespaces`    | Should namespaces automatically be repaired. This option will be passed on to the `XmlWriter` |
| `xmlDeclMode`         | The mode to use for emitting XML declarations (<?xml ...?>). Replaces omitXmlDecl for more finegrained control |
| -`omitXmlDecl`-       | *Deprecated* (use `xmlDeclMode`). Should the generated XML contain an XML declaration or not. This is passed to the `XmlWriter` |
| `indentString`        | The indentation to use. Must be a combination of XML whitespace or comments (this is checked). This is passed to the `XmlWriter` |
| `indent`              | *Deprecated for reading*: The indentation level (in spaces) to use. This is backed by `indentString`. Reading is "invalid" for `indentString` values that are not purely string sequences. Writing it will set indentation as the specified amount of spaces. |
| autoPolymorphic       | Should polymorphic information be retrieved using `SerializersModule` configuration. This replaces `XmlPolyChildren`, but changes serialization where that annotation is not applied. This option will become the default in the future although XmlPolyChildren will retain precedence (when present) |
| `unknownChildHandler` | A function that is called when an unknown child is found. By default an exception is thrown but the function can silently ignore it as well. |

## Algorithms
XML and Kotlin data types are not perfectly alligned. As such there are some algorithms that aim to automatically do the
best thing.
### Storage type
The way a field is stored is determined as follows:

- If the field has an annotation such as `@XmlElement` or `XmlValue`  this will take precedence
- If the serializer is a primitive this will normally be serialized as attribute
- If the serializer is a list, if there is an `@XmlChildrenName` annotation, this will trigger named list mode where a wrapper
  tag is used. Otherwise the list elements will be written directly as tags (even primitives) using a "transparent/anonymous" list.
- If a primitive is written as tag this will use the name as tag name, and value as element content.
- If the serializer is polymorphic this enforces tag mode. If `@XmlPolyChildren` is specified or `autoPolymorphic` is set
  it triggers transparent polymorphism mode where the child name is used to look up the property it belongs to. (note that this
  is incorrect with multiple properties that could contain the same polymorphic value - unless @XmlPolyChildren overrides it).
- Otherwise it will be written as a tag   

### Tag/attribute name
Based upon the storage type, the effective name for an attribute is determined as follows:
- `@XmlSerialName` at property declaration site
- `@XmlSerialName` at type declaration site
- `@SerialName` at property declaration site
- property name at property declaration site

The effective name for a tag is determined as follows for normal serializers:
- `@XmlSerialName` at property declaration site
- `@XmlSerialName` at type declaration site
- `@SerialName` at type declaration site
- type name at type declaration site

## Annotations

| Annotation | property | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`@XmlSerialName` | | Specify more detailed name information than can be provided by `kotlinx.serialization.SerialName`. In particular, it is not reliably possible to distinguish between `@SerialName` and the type name. We also need to specify namespace and prefix information. |
| | `value: String` | the local part of the name |
| | `namespace: String` | the namespace to use |
| | `val prefix: String` | The prefix to use |
|`@XmlPolyChildren` | | Mostly legacy annotation that allows specifying valid child tags for polymorphic resolution.
| | `value: Array<String>` | Each string specifies a child according to the following format: `childSerialName[=[prefix:]localName]`. The `childSerialName` is the name value of the descriptor. By default that would be the class name, but `@SerialName` will change that. If the name is prefixed with a `.` the package name of the container will be prefixed. Prefix is the namespace prefix to use (the namespace will be looked up based upon this). Localname allows to specify the local name of the tag.
| `@XmlChildrenName` | |  Used in lists. This causes the children to be serialized as separate tags in an outer tag. The outer tag name is determined regularly.
|`@XmlElement` | | Force a property to be either serialized as tag or attribute. |
| | `value: Boolean` | `true` to indicate serialization as tag, `false` to indicate serialization as attribute. Note that not all values can be serialized as attribute |
|`@XmlValue` | | Force a property to be element content. Note that only one field can be element content and tags would not be expected. |
| `@XmlDefault` | | Older versions of the framework do not support default values. This annotation allows a default value to be specified. The default value will not be written out if matched. |
| | `value: String` | The default value used if no value is specified. The value is parsed as if there was textual substitution of this value into the serialized XML. |


## Special type
The `CompactFragment` class is a special class (with supporting serializer) that will be able to capture the tag soup
content of an element. Instead of using regular serialization its custom serializer will (in the case of xml serialization)
directly read all the child content of the tag and store it as string content. It will also make a best effort attempt
at retaining all namespace declarations necessary to understand this tag soup.

## Modules

### core
Container for the core library (versions)

### core.common
All code shared between Javascript and Java (either jvm or android)

### core.common-nonshared
All code that is common, but not shared between Jvm and Android platforms

### core.android
Code specific to the Android platform (Pulls in core.java as API dependency). This is a regular jar rather than an AAR
as the only specific thing to Android is the XML library

### core.java
Implementation of the shared code for Java based platforms (both Android and JVM)

### core.js
Javascript based implementation

### core.jvm
Code unique to the JVM platform (Pulls in core.java as API dependency)

### Serialization
The kotlinx.serialization plugin to allow serialization to XML

### Serialization.java
The java version of the serialization plugin. Please note that it does not pull in the platform specific library. The
core library is dependent on the actual platform used (JVM or Android). This library only pulls in the shared Java code.

### Serialization.jvm
The JVM version merely uses the jvm platform xml library but the serialization is
### Serialization.android

### Serialization.js
The Javascript version of the serialization plugin. This is not yet implemented due to missing annotation support for
javascript and the 0.6.0 version of kotlinx.serialization not supporting type annotations.

### Serialization.test-android
An android test project to test serialization on Android.
